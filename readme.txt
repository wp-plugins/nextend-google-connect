One click registration & login plugin for Google? Easy installation? Is it totally free and comes with support? Yeah!

== Description ==

Personally, I hate to fill out registration forms, waiting for confirmation e-mails, so we designed this plugin for our website. Now, we want to share this very usable plugin with everyone, for free!
 
**Why should you choose Nextend Google Connect plugin from the many social plugins?**

* If your visitors have a Google profile, they can register your site with a single click, and later to log in too.
* The previously registered users can simply attach their existing Google profile to their account, so in the future, they can logging in with the one social button.
* The plugin has multiple desings, so it fits all kind of websites smoothly and elegantly. - Soon
* Very simple to use.
* Fast and helpful support.
* Totally free.
